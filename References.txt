I asked Professor Baruch on how to fix and input issue

I based some of the character names from a game called Archeage

I referenced some conceptual RPG knowledge from Final Fantasy

I got help from my friend Alex on how to call a function from another class.

I asked Omer on how to instantiate an Array

DingFeng told me to add and extra '=' to my boolean parameter

DingFeng fixed my code where I couldn't call up a boolean, and adjusted it so that my function would take the method allDead()

DingFeng fixed my code where the game would not end

Omer suggested I add a scan.nextLine() to make the compiler prompt the user to input something
